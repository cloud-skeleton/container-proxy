# Cloud Skeleton â–º Container Proxy ðŸš€

> This repository contains the configuration and deployment files for the Cloud Skeleton Container Proxy. It leverages **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** as a secure reverse proxy to manage and route traffic in cloud-native environments, and includes a lightweight server that serves a signed `security.txt` file along with a public GPG key (`info@cloudskeleton.eu.public.asc`) used for signature verification. This server is the **[Static Web Server](https://static-web-server.net/configuration/config-file/)**.

## Overview

The Container Proxy project provides a robust reverse proxy setup using **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** to:
- Manage incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- Securely route requests to backend services.
- Automate TLS certificate management via Let's Encrypt.
- Serve a regularly updated `security.txt` file for transparency and secure communication.
- Deliver an A+ SSL configuration as verified by SSL Labs.

![SSL Labs Rating A+](./assets/ssllabs-rating.jpg)

The primary configuration is defined in the `compose.yml` file, which sets up two main services:
- **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/):** The reverse proxy service.
- **[Static Web Server](https://static-web-server.net/configuration/config-file/):** A server that serves the `security.txt` file at `/.well-known/security.txt`.

## Security File Rotation & Verification

- **Monthly Rotation:**  
  The `security.txt` file is automatically rotated every month. It is updated with new expiration dates and other dynamic information. To ensure the system always serves the latest version, it is recommended to automate a `git pull` followed by a `docker compose restart` (or a similar solution) on a monthly basis.

- **Signature Verification:**  
  The `security.txt` file is PGP-signed to guarantee its authenticity. Alongside this file, the repository provides the public GPG key (`info@cloudskeleton.eu.public.asc`). Use this key to verify the signature of `security.txt` and ensure that it has not been tampered with.

Example `security.txt` content:
```

## Configuration

The deployment is driven by a compose file that utilizes several environment variables. You can define these variables in a `.env` file located alongside `compose.yml`.

### Environment Variables

- **ADMIN_IP**  
  *Description:* The IP address permitted to access the **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** dashboard.  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  ADMIN_IP=203.0.113.42
  ```

- **CERTIFICATE_EMAIL**  
  *Description:* The email address used for Let's Encrypt certificate registration.  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  CERTIFICATE_EMAIL=admin@example.com
  ```

- **DOCKER_SOCKET**  
  *Description:* The path to the Docker socket. Useful if running on a host with a non-standard socket path.  
  *Default:* `/var/run/docker.sock`  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  DOCKER_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock
  ```

- **HOSTNAME**  
  *Description:* The hostname for the **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** service. This is used in extra hosts and healthchecks.  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  HOSTNAME=proxy.example.com
  ```

- **SSL_LABS_IPV4_CIDR**  
  *Description:* The IPv4 CIDR block used for SSL Labs certificate validation.  
  *Default:* `64.41.200.0/24`  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  SSL_LABS_IPV4_CIDR=64.41.200.0/24
  ```

- **SSL_LABS_IPV6_CIDR**  
  *Description:* The IPv6 CIDR block used for SSL Labs certificate validation.  
  *Default:* `2600:c02:1020:4202::/64`  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  SSL_LABS_IPV6_CIDR=2600:c02:1020:4202::/64
  ```

- **STATIC_WEB_SERVER_VERSION**  
  *Description:* The version of the static web server image used by the **[Static Web Server](https://static-web-server.net/configuration/config-file/)**.  
  *Default:* `2.36.0`  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  STATIC_WEB_SERVER_VERSION=2.36.0
  ```

- **TRAEFIK_VERSION**  
  *Description:* The version of the **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** image to deploy.  
  *Default:* `3.3.3`  
  *Example:*  
  ```env
  TRAEFIK_VERSION=3.3.3
  ```

## Usage

1. **Create a `.env` file**  
   Place a `.env` file in the repository root with the required variables. For example:

   ```env
   ADMIN_IP=203.0.113.42
   CERTIFICATE_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   DOCKER_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock
   HOSTNAME=proxy.example.com
   SSL_LABS_IPV4_CIDR=64.41.200.0/24
   SSL_LABS_IPV6_CIDR=2600:c02:1020:4202::/64
   STATIC_WEB_SERVER_VERSION=2.36.0
   TRAEFIK_VERSION=3.3.3
   ```

2. **Deploy with Compose**  
   Run the following command to start the services:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Automate Updates**  
   To ensure the latest `security.txt` is always served, set up an automated job (e.g., via cron or CI/CD) to:
   - Pull the latest changes with `git pull`.
   - Restart the services using `docker compose restart`.

4. **Verify the Security File**  
   Use the provided public GPG key (`info@cloudskeleton.eu.public.asc`) to verify the signature of `security.txt` and ensure its integrity.

## External Integration & DNS Setup

- **Integration with Other Compose Files:**  
  It is expected that users may run other compose files on the same machine. For these setups:
  - Create an external network named `proxy_bridge` and attach your services to this network.
  - **Do not expose ports directly in your service definitions; only the **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** service should expose ports.**
  - Control service exposure using simple **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** labels. For example, in your own `compose.yml`:

  ```yaml
  networks:
    proxy_bridge:
      external: true

  services:
    my-service:
      image: my-service-image
      networks:
        - proxy_bridge
      labels:
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.http.routers.customRouter.rule=Host("www.domain.com")
  ```

- **DNS Configuration:**  
  Before using the reverse proxy, ensure that you set up the required DNS A record pointing your domain (e.g., `proxy.example.com`) to the IP address of the host running the Container Proxy. This is essential for proper routing of external traffic.

- **Traefik Dashboard Access:**  
  The **[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)** dashboard is accessible at the `/traefik` endpoint but only from the IP address specified in the `ADMIN_IP` variable. Ensure that your DNS and firewall settings restrict access accordingly.
